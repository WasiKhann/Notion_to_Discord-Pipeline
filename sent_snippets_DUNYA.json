  "It\u2019s Okay to Accomplish Less: It is fine to prioritize investments into things you love, like family, even if it means you cannot pursue your passions as much or accomplish as much as others who have fewer commitments": "2025-11-17T02:07:51.767181",
  "A central lesson is understanding the misleading nature of public success and how it impacts your internal motivation:\nAvoid Drawing the Wrong Conclusion: Observing someone's impressive technical achievements (like PewDiePie customizing Arch Linux or building a high-end self-hosting AI rig) can lead to anxiety, impostor syndrome, or an existential crisis if you draw the wrong conclusion": "2025-11-17T02:07:51.767181",

  "Accept Differences: It is okay if others learn faster or know more about specific topics, especially if those topics do not genuinely interest you. It is also fine to be a 9-to-5 worker who pursues unrelated hobbies like ultimate frisbee or playing guitar.
